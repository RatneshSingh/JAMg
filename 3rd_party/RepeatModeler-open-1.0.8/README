RepeatModeler - 1.0.4 
=====================

Arian Smit, Robert Hubley - Institute for Systems Biology

RepeatModeler is a de novo repeat family identification and modeling
package. At the heart of RepeatModeler are two de-novo repeat finding
programs ( RECON and RepeatScout ) which employ complementary computational
methods for identifying repeat element boundaries and family relationships
from sequence data.  RepeatModeler assists in automating the runs of RECON
and RepeatScout given a genomic database and uses the output to build, 
refine and classify consensus models of putative interspersed repeats.

Prerequisites
-------------

  Perl
    Available at http://www.perl.org/get.html. Developed and tested
    with version 5.8.8.

  RepeatMasker & Libraries
    Developed and tested with open-3.2.9. The program is available at 
    http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html and the libraries are
    at http://www.girinst.org.

  RECON - De Novo Repeat Finder, Bao Z. and Eddy S.R.
    Developed and tested with version 1.0.5. The program is available at
    http://selab.janelia.org/recon.html.

  RepeatScout - De Novo Repeat Finder, Price A.L., Jones N.C. and Pevzner P.A.
    Developed and tested with our multiple sequence version of RepeatScout 
    ( 1.0.3 ).  This version is now available at 
    http://repeatscout.bioprojects.org/

  TRF - Tandem Repeat Finder, G. Benson et al.
    You can obtain a free copy at http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html. 
    RepeatModeler was developed using 3.2.1.

  And one or both of the following:

  RMBlast - A modified version of NCBI Blast for use with RepeatMasker
    and RepeatModeler.  Precompiled binaries and source can be found at
    http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMBlast.html

  or

  WUBlast/ABBlast - Sequence Search Engine, W. Gish et al.
    Developed and tested with 2.0 [04-May-2006]. The latest versions
    of ABBlast may be downloaded from: http://blast.advbiocomp.com/licensing/



Installation
------------

  1. Uncompress and expand the distribution archive:

     Typically:   tar -zxvf RepeatModeler-open-#.#.#.tar.gz
                or
                  gunzip RepeatModeler-open-#.#.#.tar.gz
                  tar -xvf RepeatModeler-open-#.#.#.tar

  2. Configure for your site:

     Automatic:
       1. Run the "configure" script contained in the RepeatModeler
          distribution as:
 
               perl ./configure
 
     By Hand:
       1. Copy the file "RepModelConfig.pm.tmpl" to "RepModelConfig.pm" 
       2. Edit the configuration parameters with a text editor.
 


Example Run
-----------

In this example we first downloaded elephant () sequences
from Genbank ( approx 11MB ) into a file called elephant.fa. 

  1. Create a Database for RepeatModeler

     RepeatModeler uses a ABBlast/WUBlast XDF database or a NCBI 
     DB ( depending on the search engine used ) as input to the
     repeat modeling pipeline.  A utility is provided to assist
     the user in creating a single database from several 
     types of input structures.  

     <RepeatModelerPath>/BuildDatabase -name elephant elephant.fa

     Run "BuildDatabase" without any options in order to see the 
     full documentation on this utility. There are several options
     which make it easier to import multiple sequence files into
     one database.
  
     NOTE: It is a good idea to place your datafiles and run this
           program suite from a local disk rather than over NFS.

  2. Run RepeatModeler
     
     RepeatModeler runs several compute intensive programs on the
     input sequence.  For best results run this on a machine with
     a moderate amount of memory and several processors.  Our typical
     setup was P4 - 4 cpus, 2.4Ghz, 3GB Memory, and Red Hat Linux. 
     
     nohup <RepeatModelerPath>/RepeatModeler -database elephant >& run.out &
     
     The nohup is used on our machines when running long ( > 3-4 hour ) 
     jobs.  The output is saved to a file and the process is backgrounded.
     For typical runtimes ( can be > 2 days with this configuration )
     see the run statistics section of this file.

  3. Interpret the results

     This development version of RepeatModeler produces a voluminous
     amount of output.  The output is directed to a working directory
     named RM_<PID>.<DATE> ie. "RM_5098.MonMar141305172005".  
     In the working directory the final product, a file named
     "consensi.fa.classified" can be found.  This is formatted as
     a RepeatMasker library and may be used directly with RepeatMasker
     as:

     <RepeatMaskerPath>/RepeatMasker -lib consensi.fa.classified mySequence.fa 

     Other files produced in the working directory include:

       RM_<PID>.<DATE>/
          round-1/
               sampleDB-#.fa       : The genomic sample used in this round

                                     ( such as firefox ).

Caveats
-------

  o Genomes with numerous short contigs ( Diatom for example )
    will take longer to BLAST than larger genomes with 
    larger contigs.  This is an optimization problem left for 
    future releases. 

  o This program is not parallelized.  It can only run on
    one node.  This is something we are considering for future
    releases.
