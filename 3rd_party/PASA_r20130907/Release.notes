Improvements in memory usage during BLAT output processing, comprehensive transcriptome-generation, and assembly description writer.

Parallel cluster reassignment, and faster uploading to mysql.



##############################
# Release: PASA2-r20130605p1
#############################

alignment validation:
    -alignment validation is now not case-sensitive (but introduced in the most recent release).
    -includes a 'resume' mode in case the process breaks partially into this stage.

PASA_transcripts_and_assemblies_to_GFF3.dbi:
    -include 'gene' clustering information in pasa assembly GTF output.

# Stable Release PASA2-r20130605
#################################

Web portal:
    -all the CGI scripts in the PASA web portal are now compatible with PASA2

Alignment validation:
    -uses memory-lean indexing of fasta files rather than storing all seqs in RAM. Additional improvements to multi-threading and mem-sharing.

Alignment assembly:
    -individual alignment clusters capped at 5k alignments, sampled according to alignment score and alignment position.

BLAT alignments:
    -use file-based sorting to reduce RAM requirements.

PASA2-related improvements:

1. both GMAP and BLAT can be run simultaneously, and multiple high quality validating alignments at different genome locations can be leveraged for defining gene structures via PASA assembly.

2. Lots of multithreading.   Use the new --CPU parameter to take advantage of multiple threads.  Overall, the system is much faster that earlier versions due to parallel processing.  Also, database interaction has vastly sped up.

3. Transdecoder (use --TRANSDECODER) can be executed as part of running PASA.  Transcripts that appear to be coding and full-length are flagged by PASA and treated accordingly.

4.  A new process is available that combines Trinity de novo RNA-Seq assemblies along with genome-based transcript reconstructions (cufflinks and genome-guided Trinity) to generate a comprehensive transcriptome database.  This facilitates the identification of 'missing' genes and captures those transcripts that may be insufficiently represented by a draft genome assembly.  Instructions for this are available here:
