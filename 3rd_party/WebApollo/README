Webservices
===========
The /ws directory needs to go your /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps directory

* You need to install SignalP-4.1 as 
ws/signalp-4.1

* MAFFT binaries as
ws/mafft_bin

* you will need JmolApplet.jar jalview.js and jalviewApplet.jar to be placed as 
ws/jalview.js ws/JmolApplet.jar ws/jalviewApplet.jar

* You can place profiles in ws/profiles/ as FASTA alignments (e.g. via mafft, see examples)


AnnotTrack.js
This file belongs to WebApollo version 22 Nov 2013: https://apollo-web.googlecode.com/files/WebApollo-2013-11-22.tgz

It goes here (backup the original):
/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/plugins/WebApollo/js/View/Track/

It adds the webservices. Feel free to edit as you see fit.


BTW, we're assuming you have Tomcat 7 (if that wasn't obvious already)
