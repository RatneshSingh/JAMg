# first time; install perl libraries
export PATH=$PATH:$JAMG_PATH/3rd_party/mysql/bin
cpan DBD::mysql DBI # you can do that as user

# Be nice and safe: remember to only have for as long as you need it...
killall mysqld # to end it

PASA:
In the configuration of pasa, don't forget to add the port number after the server, e.g.
localhost:3336

FAQ on ERROR:
failed: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2) at /data/software/JAMg/3rd_party/PASA_r20140417/scripts/..//PerlLib/Mysql_connect.pm line 30.

Sometimes this happens (e.g. Ubuntu). FOr some reason it means it is looking for /tmp/mysql.sock as socket= in the mysql configuration.
in this case, stop mysql, change all socket= (there is 3 of them) in the ~/.my.cnf to match whatever it is looking for and restart the mysql
