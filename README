The main perl script, prepare_golden_genes_for_predictors.pl, is what you will need to use. 

Use perldoc to see any ancillary information.

To generate the softmasking, use RepeatMasker (for example) and bedtools (accepts a GFF file).

For example,
$ RepeatMasker -pa $CPUS -s -species insecta -no_is -gccalc -gff 
# softmask
$ maskFastaFromBed -fi $ASSEMBLTY -fo $ASSEMBLY.repeatmasked.soft -bed $ASSEMBLY.out.gff -soft
# hardmask
$ maskFastaFromBed -fi $ASSEMBLTY -fo $ASSEMBLY.repeatmasked.hard -bed $ASSEMBLY.out.gff # or the .masked output from RepeatMasker
