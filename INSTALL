Installation is pretty straightforward on a Linux system such as Ubuntu:

In practice, you do not need to execute anything as root as long as you are able to install CPAN modules as a user.
Almost all third party software are provided in 3rd_party and will be installed as the user within the JAMG directory.
The only not installed is emboss which is complicated to install in the user-space (and is useful to have system wide
anyway).

The following perl modules are required.
* Pod::Usage
* Data::Dumper
* Getopt::Long
* List::Util
* Digest::SHA

You can install via CPAN:
$ cpan Pod::Usage Data::Dumper Getopt::Long List::Util Digest::SHA

Note that Pod::Usage Data::Dumper are only used for error messages so you could edit them out if you have to.

The following software are required.
 * emboss
 
You can install them using a repository, e.g. on an Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install emboss
