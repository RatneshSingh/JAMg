Hello

JAMg has a large number of dependencies but almost all are provided under 3rd_party so you don't have to go looking. 
Also everything should install with the make command automatically. However first you need some dependencies.

Installation is pretty straightforward on a Linux system such as Ubuntu. If you're using an OSX then you're on your own 
as I never had a Mac, however, if you manage to install and are an expert willing to help others, let me know.

In practice, you do not need to execute anything as root as long as you are able to install the above CPAN modules as a user.
Almost all third party software are provided in 3rd_party and will be installed as the user within the JAMG directory.
The only not installed is emboss which is complicated to install in the user-space (and is useful to have system wide
anyway).


= Dependencies
==============
The following perl modules are required.
* Pod::Usage
* Data::Dumper
* Getopt::Long
* List::Util
* Digest::SHA

You can install via CPAN:
$ cpan Pod::Usage Data::Dumper Getopt::Long List::Util Digest::SHA

Note that Pod::Usage Data::Dumper are only used for error messages so you could edit them out if you have to.

The following software are required.
 * emboss
 
You can install them using a repository, e.g. on an Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install emboss

= Next step
===========
Then download the RepeatMasker libraries from GIRI (free registration required; 2 day waiting period) http://www.girinst.org
NB: "This version of RepeatMasker requires library version 20140131 or higher".
Place repeatmaskerlibraries-*.tar.gz in $JAMG_PATH/3rd_party/RepeatMasker

Then run 
make 2>&1 | tee make.log

This will take some time because there are a lot of third party utilities being made.

If there is an error, I'm not sure if I can help. Send the make.log but it is likely that the best option
is to see which program was the last one (i.e. the one that failed) and try to compile it manually. It is not
unlikely that your system is lacking a dependency (e.g. for Ubuntu/Debian see the 'apt-get build-dep' command, e.g.
apt-get build-dep exonerate). If you don't want to do, you should talk to your system administrator.

After it finishes you have to configure RepeatMasker
cd $JAMG_PATH/3rd_party/RepeatMasker; ./configure
Answer the prompts and use RM-BLAST
file paths are in the JAMg distribution, e.g.
$JAMG_PATH/3rd_party/RepeatMasker
$JAMG_PATH/3rd_party/ncbi-blast/bin
