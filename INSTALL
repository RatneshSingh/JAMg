Installation is pretty straightforward on a Linux system such as Ubuntu:

The following perl modules are required.
* Pod::Usage
* Data::Dumper
* Getopt::Long
* List::Util
* Digest::SHA

Note that using the gene predictors requires BioPerl. Otherwise use the option
 -stop_golden

You can install via CPAN:
$ cpan Pod::Usage Data::Dumper Getopt::Long List::Util Digest::SHA

Note that Pod::Usage Data::Dumper are only used for error messages so you could edit them out if you have to.

The following software are required.
 * exonerate (2.2.0)
 * emboss
 * NCBI's BLAST C++ package
 
You can install them using a repository, e.g. on an Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install exonerate emboss ncbi-blast+

The following software are supported and therefore required if you want to generate input for the gene prediction software
 * Augustus
 * SNAP
 * geneid

I've provided working versions for each one to facilitate testing but you should download the 
latest versions of SNAP and Augustus for your work (e.g. the Augustus version is not 
distributed using all tutorials/config files that normally come with Augustus).

GeneID has been edited to make it work (for my system at least).

Transdecoder is also provided but without the PFAM database. If you'd like to predict proteins properly, 
then please include a PFAM database (one is provided at the sourceforge repository).

Please not that exonerate is not free of bugs but this software tries to deal with some of them.
