Installation is pretty straightforward on a Linux system such as Ubuntu:

The following perl modules are required.
* Pod::Usage
* Data::Dumper
* Getopt::Long
* List::Util
* Digest::SHA

You can install via CPAN:
$ cpan Pod::Usage Data::Dumper Getopt::Long List::Util Digest::SHA

Note that Pod::Usage Data::Dumper are only used for error messages so you could edit them out if you have to.

The following software are required.
 * exonerate (2.2.0)
 * emboss
 * NCBI's BLAST C++ package
 * blat 
 
You can install them using a repository, e.g. on an Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install exonerate emboss ncbi-blast+ blat

The following software are supported and therefore required if you want to generate input for the gene prediction software
 * Augustus
 * SNAP
 * geneid

I've provided working versions for each one to facilitate your work but feel free to download the 
latest versions of SNAP and Augustus.
